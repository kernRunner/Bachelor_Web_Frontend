                <p>The use of Strato is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in the most reliable
                    presentation of our website. If a corresponding consent has been requested, processing is carried
                    out exclusively based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG, as far as the consent includes the
                    storage of cookies or access to information in the user's device (e.g., device fingerprinting)

                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Data Protection</h3>
                <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
                    personal data confidentially and according to the statutory data protection regulations as well as
                    this privacy policy.</p>
                <p>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data that can
                    personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for.
                    It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
                <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by e-mail)
                    can have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of the data from access by third parties is
                    not possible.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Notice concerning the Responsible Party</h3>
                <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
                <p>Distance Reacher<br />
                    Ernst Lehner Str. 8</p>

                    E-mail: impactfulvoyage@gmail.com</p> -->
                <!-- <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the
                    purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p> -->
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Storage Duration</h3>
                <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal
                    data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing ceases to apply. If you make a
                    legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
                    deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax
                    or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these
                    reasons cease to apply.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
                <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
                    Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the
                    case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is
                    also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to
                    information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is
                    additionally based on § 25(1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is
                    necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures,
                    we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is
                    necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be
                    based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal
                    bases in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
                <p>In the context of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, the
                    transfer of personal data to these external parties is necessary. We only pass on personal data to
                    external parties if this is necessary within the framework of contract execution, if we are legally
                    obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in
                    the transfer according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer.
                    When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers based on a valid processing
                    contract. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing contract is concluded.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
                <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke an
                    already given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the
                    revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising
                    (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
                <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE
                    PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION;
                    THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH
                    PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS
                    YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE
                    PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE
                    ASSERTION, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
                <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY
                    TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
                    PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
                    DATA WILL THEN NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21(2) GDPR).
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
                <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a
                    supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work,
                    or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to
                    other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Right to Data Portability</h3>
                <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in the
                    performance of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable
                    format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done
                    to the extent technically feasible.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
                <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about
                    your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of the data processing and, if
                    applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose and for further
                    questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do this,
                    you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following
                    cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify
                        this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the
                        processing of your personal data.</li>
                    <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data
                        processing instead of deletion.</li>
                    <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion
                        of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
                        personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                    <li>If you have lodged an objection under Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your and
                        our interests. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to
                        request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from being stored
                    – only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or
                    for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important
                    public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
                <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of
                    confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can
                    recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from
                    "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
                <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-3xl mt-8 font-semibold">4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Inquiry by E-Mail, Telephone, or Fax</h3>
                <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone, or fax, your inquiry, including all resulting personal data
                    (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We
                    do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
                <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the
                    performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all
                    other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the
                    inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has
                    been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
                <p>The data you send to us via contact inquiries will remain with us until you request us to delete it,
                    revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your
                    request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular, statutory retention
                    periods – remain unaffected.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Google Tag Manager</h3>
                <p>We use Google Tag Manager to manage website tags via an interface. The Google Tag Manager itself,
                    which deploys the tags, is a cookie-less domain and does not collect any personal data. The tool
                    triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data.
                    If deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, it remains for all tracking tags
                    implemented with Google Tag Manager.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Google Analytics</h3>
                <p>This website uses features of the web analytics service Google Analytics. The provider is Google
                    Ireland Limited (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
                <p>Google Analytics uses so-called &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;. These are text files that are stored on your
                    computer and that allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the
                    cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and
                    stored there.</p>
                <p>The storage of Google Analytics cookies and the use of this analysis tool are based on Art. 6(1)(f)
                    GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its
                    web offer and its advertising. If a corresponding consent has been requested (e.g., consent to the
                    storage of cookies), processing is carried out exclusively based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the consent
                    can be revoked at any time.</p>
                <p>IP anonymization: We have activated the IP anonymization function on this website. As a result, your
                    IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other
                    contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before being transmitted to the
                    USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA
                    and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to
                    evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website activity, and provide other services
                    relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted
                    by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.</p>
                <p>Browser Plugin: You can prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your
                    browser software; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full
                    functionality of this website. You can also prevent the collection of the data generated by the
                    cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the

                <p>Participation in these affiliate programs is based on our legitimate interest in the most efficient
                    design of our website as well as the optimization of our online offer (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). If a
                    corresponding consent has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively based on Art.

                <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Google Maps</h3>
                <p>This site uses the Google Maps map service. The provider is Google Ireland Limited
                    (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. With the help of this
                    service, we can embed map material on our website.</p>
                <p>To use the functions of Google Maps, it is necessary to store your IP address. This information is
                    usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this site has no
                    influence on this data transmission. If Google Maps is activated, Google may use Google Fonts for
                    the uniform display of fonts. When you call up Google Maps, your browser loads the required web
                    fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p>
                <p>The use of Google Maps is in the interest of an attractive presentation of our online offers and easy
                    findability of the locations indicated by us on the website. This constitutes a legitimate interest
                    under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If a corresponding consent has been requested, processing is carried out
                    exclusively based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG, as far as the consent includes the storage
                    of cookies or access to information in the user's device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the
                    meaning of the TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
                <p>Data transmission to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission.
